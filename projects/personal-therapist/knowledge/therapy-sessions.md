=== SESSION START ===
## Session 04-30-25

### Issues Discussed
Wife's chronic pain flare triggered by work stress and family visit; frustration with her avoidance of medical care; anger about divorce article she sent; feeling caught between supporting her and maintaining own needs; daily morning restrictions (7am-12pm quiet time) impacting productivity and autonomy; wife's controlling behaviors during flares

### Key Insights
Recognized pattern where stress triggers wife's pain which creates more stress (vicious cycle); identified that wife's need for control during flares is her attempt to manage unpredictable health situation; acknowledged frustration with feeling like loyalty is constantly questioned; realized wife hasn't seen specialists in over a year, possibly due to recent move and discouragement with lack of progress

### Strategies Introduced/Discussed
Three approaches for managing divorce article discussion - brief acknowledgment with boundaries, scheduling specific discussion time, or validating feelings without lengthy engagement; importance of timing conversations about medical care after flare subsides rather than during crisis

### Progress Updates
Family visit happening this weekend with agreed-upon morning noise restrictions; wife experiencing flare coinciding with multiple stressors (reduced work hours, family visit); living situation still impacted by ongoing renovations

### Action Items
Plan conversation with wife about resuming medical care after current flare ends; implement one of the three approaches for handling divorce article discussion; focus on getting through family visit weekend; consider how to frame medical care discussion as support rather than criticism

## Session 05-20-25

### Issues Discussed
Wife sent divorce article triggering anticipatory anxiety about day derailment; successful navigation of that situation; escalating morning routine restrictions (kitchen access, water, dog); deeper exploration of intimacy/affection disconnect - feeling unable to naturally want to initiate despite enjoying closeness when it happens; chronic emotional burnout from years of being primary emotional support; task-management mental mode preventing relaxation and romantic connection; guilt about relaxing and self-care; expanding control issues around house access for basic needs like water and dog

### Key Insights
Intimacy resistance stems from years of emotional depletion and caregiver burnout, not lack of love; procrastination is attempt to steal back autonomy when feeling over-responsible; being in constant task-management mode kills natural desire for connection; wife's accommodation requests expanding beyond reasonable (now includes basic kitchen access); current restrictions feel like rewarding unreasonable control rather than legitimate medical accommodation

### Strategies Introduced/Discussed
Scheduling relaxation as a task to bypass guilt; morning mental inventory for intimacy intentions before entering task mode; beach coffee mornings for genuine relaxation away from house responsibilities; reframing rest as necessary maintenance rather than laziness; holding boundaries on basic house functioning (water, dog access)

### Progress Updates
Successfully handled divorce article conversation without it derailing entire day; started morning beach routine but feeling unable to relax due to new restrictions; relationship dynamic showing pattern of expanding control despite accommodations already made

### Action Items
Implement morning beach coffee routine for relaxation; practice scheduled relaxation periods; try weekly intentional intimacy initiation; maintain boundary about basic kitchen/house access while being willing to discuss reasonable solutions

## Session 05-28-25

### Issues Discussed
Escalating morning kitchen restrictions now limited to 1-hour windows out of 4 hours; wife's expanding control over basic house access including getting water from fridge; recognition this has become his absolute boundary; preparation for difficult conversation about reasonable vs unreasonable accommodations

### Key Insights
Role-play revealed wife's pattern of deflecting boundary conversations through emotional escalation, crisis mode, and nuclear threats rather than problem-solving; identified logical inconsistency between managing uncontrollable apartment noise vs requiring complete silence for basic activities; recognized that maximum control is being exercised now that it's available rather than using previously demonstrated coping skills; client has reached his limit for accommodation

### Strategies Introduced/Discussed
Conversation framework starting with understanding (temporary vs permanent restrictions) rather than accusations; using apartment vs house noise comparison as strongest logical argument; prepared responses to multiple deflection tactics; study guide format to prevent caving under pressure during difficult conversation

### Progress Updates
Client has identified absolute boundary after restrictions expanded to basic kitchen access including water; prepared for potentially relationship-defining conversation about sustainable vs unsustainable accommodation levels

### Action Items
Have boundary conversation using prepared study guide; start with temporary vs permanent question; hold ground despite escalation; stay focused on practical problem-solving; determine if reasonable accommodation is possible or if professional help needed

## Session 05-31-25

### Issues Discussed
Family disappointment over 5-month floor delay despite working to get house ready; wife's hurt about therapy suggestion escalating to "I don't want to be open with you"; cultural differences in family support (wife's immigrant family offering concrete help vs. his family's extended "gift"); stepdad's poor time management affecting project timelines; balancing family relationships while protecting wife from additional stress

### Key Insights
Wife's statement reveals years-long pattern of emotional withdrawal and feeling unsafe being vulnerable; family "gift" has become burden due to stepdad's controlling approach and poor boundaries; mom caught in middle between wanting to help and stepdad's rigidity; previous confrontation where client told stepdad to leave demonstrated commitment to wife's wellbeing over family peace-keeping

### Strategies Introduced/Discussed
Responding to wife's vulnerability by centering her experience rather than explaining intentions; keeping house topics off-limits in family conversations; accepting family limitations rather than trying to change dynamics; focusing energy on relationships that can be influenced (mom, half-brother) rather than those that can't (stepdad)

### Progress Updates
Successfully reframed response to wife's vulnerability; made decision to let floor timeline play out rather than confronting family; recognized that stepdad's work patterns reflect broader time management and boundary issues

### Action Items
Maintain boundaries about house discussions with family; if wife opens up more about emotional withdrawal, focus on listening and witnessing rather than defending; keep family contact separate from house stress

## Session 06-02-25

### Issues Discussed
Laundry restriction request due to new washer affecting water pressure; struggle with determining reasonable vs unreasonable accommodations; wife's slow progress on medical care despite some movement; expanding time restrictions now affecting all household activities (laundry, dishes, showers) to 12pm-6pm window only

### Key Insights
Real issue isn't individual requests but systematic compression of client's functional time in own home from morning restrictions; wife frames her medical self-care as accommodation to him, creating pressure for him to match with unreasonable restrictions; current solution pattern always involves restricting his schedule rather than finding alternatives; he's moving toward tenant status with restricted privileges rather than partner sharing home

### Strategies Introduced/Discussed
Reframing conversations from "what times work" to "how can we solve this without further restricting my schedule"; focusing on spatial, equipment, or alternative solutions rather than time-based restrictions; recognizing medical self-care vs relationship accommodation distinction

### Progress Updates
Wife making slow progress on medical care referrals but still resistant to therapy; client recognizing pattern of shrinking functional time window rather than individual accommodation issues

### Action Items
Prepare for bigger conversation about sustainable coexistence rather than individual accommodation battles; practice articulating that current trajectory is unsustainable; consider non-time-restriction solutions (spatial, equipment, routine adjustments)

## Session 06-06-25 (Session A)

### Issues Discussed
Reddit addiction and infinite scrolling behavior; automatic morning phone checking; "just one more" cycle and dopamine-seeking; lack of external accountability working from home; previous RSS attempts and current FreshRSS usage; desire for 10-30 curated daily articles without noise

### Key Insights
Recognizes behavior in moment but struggles to stop due to strong urges; Reddit provides 25% relevant content vs RSS at 1% but traps in infinite scroll; addiction manifests during downtime/transitions, not when engaged; wants shift from "hunting and gathering" to "delivered meal" content consumption

### Strategies Introduced/Discussed
Using subreddit approved source lists to build RSS feeds; leveraging Reddit's crowd-sourced curation for RSS setup; converting Twitter accounts to RSS via nitter for sports content

### Progress Updates
Client motivated to try RSS approach using subreddit curation to reduce setup burden and improve sports content quality

### Action Items
Research approved sources from team subreddits (Liverpool FC, Patriots, Celtics, Red Sox); set up sports RSS feeds using nitter for Twitter accounts; aim for 10-30 quality daily articles setup
=== SESSION END ===

## Session 06-06-25 (Session B)

### Issues Discussed
Shift from Reddit content management to complete cessation; recognition that core issue is dopamine addiction and loss of control over attention; specific addiction triggers (Liverpool transfers, Black Templars codex rumors); desire to quit Reddit entirely rather than moderate usage

### Key Insights
Client correctly identified this as addiction problem rather than content curation issue; understood that "hunting mode" for infrequent but unpredictable updates creates strongest addiction pattern; recognized automatic checking behavior needs interruption, not management

### Strategies Introduced/Discussed
Friction-based intervention using Obsidian notes to track urges and reasons; replacement actions to interrupt automatic behavior; tracking urges as data to identify real information needs vs dopamine-seeking; complete cessation approach rather than moderation

### Progress Updates
Client created streamlined tracking system focused on understanding urge triggers; committed to complete Reddit cessation rather than usage management; ready to implement urge documentation protocol

### Action Items
Use simplified Obsidian tracking document when Reddit urges arise; document the "why" behind each urge before taking any action; set up alternative sources for Liverpool transfers and Black Templars news; remove Reddit access from all devices
