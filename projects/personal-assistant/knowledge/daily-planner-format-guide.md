# Daily Planner Format Guide

## Session Structure

### 1. Day Overview
**Objective**: Provide context for the day's capacity and commitments

**Format**:
```
## [DAY], [DATE] - Daily Overview

### Calendar Summary
**Scheduled Commitments:**
- [Time] - [Meeting/Appointment]
- [Time] - [Meeting/Appointment]
- [Time] - Focus Time (Work tasks)

**Available Time Assessment:**
- **Total Available Time**: [Rough estimate based on calendar + client routine]
- **Energy Context**: [Morning/Afternoon energy patterns from client profile]
- **Day Type**: [Heavy meeting day / Focus day / Mixed / Light day]
```

### 2. Top 3 Priority Tasks
**Objective**: Eliminate decision paralysis with clear daily priorities

**Selection Priority Order:**
1. Overdue tasks (by priority level)
2. Tasks due today or tomorrow
3. High-priority focus area momentum tasks
4. Strategic tasks advancing current focus areas

**Format**:
```
## Today's Top 3 Priorities

### Priority 1: [Task Name]
- **Project**: [Focus Area or General Todo]
- **Time Estimate**: [Label - @30m, @2hr, etc.]
- **Why Top Priority**: [Brief reasoning - overdue, due today, focus momentum]

### Priority 2: [Task Name]
- **Project**: [Focus Area or General Todo]
- **Time Estimate**: [Label]
- **Why Top Priority**: [Brief reasoning]

### Priority 3: [Task Name]
- **Project**: [Focus Area or General Todo]
- **Time Estimate**: [Label]
- **Why Top Priority**: [Brief reasoning]

**Success Today**: Completing these 3 tasks would make this a successful day.
```

### 3. Extra Tasks for Momentum
**Objective**: Provide options for additional progress without overwhelming

**Format**:
```
## Extra Tasks (If Time/Energy Allows)

### Quick Wins (@15m - @30m)
**For momentum building:**
- [Task Name] - [Project] - [Time estimate]
- [Task Name] - [Project] - [Time estimate]
- [Task Name] - [Project] - [Time estimate]

### Incremental Progress
**Larger tasks to break down:**
- **[Large Task Name]** - [Project]
  - *Suggested small step*: [Specific actionable piece]
  - *Time for step*: [Estimate]
- **[Large Task Name]** - [Project]
  - *Suggested small step*: [Specific actionable piece]
  - *Time for step*: [Estimate]

### Research & Shopping Tasks
**Available for AI completion:**
- [Task Name] - @research - [Brief description]
- [Task Name] - @shopping - [Brief description]

*Would you like me to complete any research or shopping tasks now?*
```

### 4. Focus Area Context
**Objective**: Connect daily tasks to larger strategic goals

**Format**:
```
## Focus Area Progress

### Today's Focus Connections
**[Personal Focus Area 1]**: [How today's tasks advance this area]
**[Personal Focus Area 2]**: [How today's tasks advance this area]
**[Work Focus Area 1]**: [How today's tasks advance this area]
**[Work Focus Area 2]**: [How today's tasks advance this area]

### Momentum Status
- **Gaining Momentum**: [Focus areas with good task completion recently]
- **Needs Attention**: [Focus areas that haven't had recent progress]
```

## Daily Planning Decision Logic

### Top 3 Selection Criteria

**Priority Order:**
1. **Overdue Tasks**: Any task past due date, prioritized by:
   - Priority level (P1 > P2 > P3)
   - Days overdue
   - Impact on focus areas

2. **Due Today/Tomorrow**: Tasks with approaching deadlines:
   - Due today (any priority level)
   - Due tomorrow (P1 and P2 only)
   - Consider time required vs. available time

3. **Focus Area Momentum**: Tasks that advance current focus areas:
   - Tasks that build on recent progress
   - Next logical steps in active projects
   - High-impact tasks for stalled areas

4. **Strategic Advancement**: Important but not urgent tasks:
   - P1/P2 tasks without dates that advance focus areas
   - Foundation-building tasks for future progress

### Extra Tasks Selection Criteria

**Quick Wins (@15m - @30m):**
- Tasks that provide immediate sense of accomplishment
- Administrative tasks that have been lingering
- Small steps toward larger goals
- Tasks that clear mental clutter

**Incremental Progress:**
- Large tasks (@+1d, @+1w) that can be broken down
- Focus on creating specific, actionable next steps
- Suggest 30-60 minute chunks of larger projects
- Identify research or planning components

### Time Estimation Considerations

**Available Time Assessment:**
- Review client routine (wake time, work hours, evening routine)
- Subtract scheduled calendar commitments
- Account for meals, commuting, and buffer time
- Consider energy patterns (morning vs. afternoon productivity)

**Realistic Task Loading:**
- Don't over-schedule available time
- Leave buffer for unexpected tasks or longer completion times
- Consider task switching overhead
- Match task intensity to energy availability

## Output Principles

### Tone & Communication
- **Decisive and Clear**: Present definitive recommendations, not options to analyze
- **Concise Explanations**: Brief reasoning for choices, not extensive justification
- **Action-Oriented**: Focus on what to do, not why it matters strategically
- **Confident**: Make clear recommendations to eliminate decision fatigue

### Information Hierarchy
1. **Must Do**: Top 3 priorities for successful day
2. **Can Do**: Extra tasks for momentum and progress
3. **Could Do**: Research/shopping tasks for AI completion

### Adaptation Guidelines

**High Energy Days:**
- Include more challenging tasks in Top 3
- Suggest tackling larger task breakdowns
- Recommend focus area advancement tasks

**Low Energy Days:**
- Prioritize quick wins and administrative tasks
- Suggest smaller, less cognitively demanding tasks
- Focus on maintenance and catching up

**Heavy Meeting Days:**
- Emphasize tasks that fit between meetings
- Suggest administrative or research tasks
- Avoid deep focus tasks requiring extended concentration

**Light Calendar Days:**
- Include larger, more complex tasks
- Suggest focus area deep work
- Recommend tackling overdue or challenging items

## Session Documentation

### Not Required for Daily Sessions
Daily planning sessions are tactical and don't require documentation in `weekly-plans.md` unless:
- Significant changes to weekly priorities are made
- Focus areas are adjusted mid-week
- Pattern of task completion/avoidance emerges that affects weekly planning

### Quick Check-ins Only
Daily sessions should be brief and action-focused, providing clear direction without extensive analysis or documentation overhead.
