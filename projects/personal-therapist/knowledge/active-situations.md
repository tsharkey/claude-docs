# Current Active Situations
## Wife's Medical Care
Wife hasn't seen pelvic floor PT or GI doctor in over a year. Recent move may have disrupted care continuity. Current diagnoses include pelvic floor dysfunction and possible IBS. Patient acknowledges stress-related pelvic floor clenching. Plan to discuss resuming care after current flare subsides.
House renovation stress continuing to impact wife's health condition. Timeline extension of floor project to 5+ months means continued living in construction environment affecting her wellbeing. Cultural contrast noted between wife's family offering immediate concrete help versus his family's extended "gift" creating ongoing stress.
## Daily Life Management
Morning quiet time restrictions (7am-12pm) have now expanded to include laundry, dishes, showers, and other household activities due to new washer affecting water pressure. Client now functionally restricted to 12pm-6pm window (25% of day) for all basic household activities. Pattern shows expanding restrictions rather than problem-solving within existing accommodations.
## Intimacy and Connection
Identified long-term pattern of intimacy initiation resistance due to emotional burnout from years of being primary emotional support. Enjoys physical connection when it happens but struggles with natural desire to initiate. Chronic task-management mental mode interfering with romantic connection.
## Social Media Addiction
Client identified problematic Reddit usage pattern involving infinite scrolling and procrastination. Reddit serves as primary source for sports news (Liverpool FC, Patriots, Celtics, Red Sox), Warhammer 40k, world news, politics, local news, and tech content. Automatic phone checking first thing in morning. Experiences "just one more" scrolling cycle with approximately 25% relevant content but gets trapped in dopamine-seeking behavior. Working from home provides no external accountability. Willpower alone ineffective against strong urges during downtime moments. Already has FreshRSS instance setup, using twice weekly but lacking good sports sources and experiencing too much noise-to-signal ratio.
