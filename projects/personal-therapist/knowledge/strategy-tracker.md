# Strategy Tracker
- **Stress Recognition**: Strategies discussed previously - need to implement during current high-stress period with family visit and wife's flare.
- **Beach Morning Routine**: Started but challenged by expanding house restrictions. Need to maintain boundaries on reasonable vs unreasonable accommodations while supporting legitimate medical needs.
- **Family Boundary Setting**: Successfully implemented boundary-setting with stepdad when he couldn't respect house rules, demonstrating prioritization of wife's needs over family peace-keeping. Decision made to avoid confrontational conversations with family about timeline disappointment to prevent additional complications. Focus shifted to protecting viable relationships (mom, half-brother) while managing stepdad's dysfunction through distance rather than engagement.
- **Accommodation Limits**: Client has reached his accommodation limit and prepared comprehensive conversation strategy using temporary vs permanent restriction framework. Recognized pattern where wife deflects boundary discussions through emotional escalation rather than problem-solving. Ready to hold boundary even if conversation escalates significantly.
- **Time Restriction Pattern**: Client has identified that individual accommodation requests are symptoms of larger pattern - systematic compression of his functional time in own home. Ready to shift from individual battle conversations to bigger picture sustainability discussion about coexistence without further time restrictions.
- **Social Media Addiction > Reddit**: New approach identified: Complete cessation with urge tracking rather than content curation solutions. Client recognized core issue as dopamine addiction requiring interruption of automatic checking behavior. Simple Obsidian-based tracking system created to document urge triggers and build intentional information sources. Focus shifted from managing Reddit usage to eliminating it entirely while understanding underlying information needs.
