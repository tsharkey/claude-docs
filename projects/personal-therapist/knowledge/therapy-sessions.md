# Current Active Situations

## Wife's Medical Care
Wife hasn't seen pelvic floor PT or GI doctor in over a year. Recent move may have disrupted care continuity. Current diagnoses include pelvic floor dysfunction and possible IBS. Patient acknowledges stress-related pelvic floor clenching. Plan to discuss resuming care after current flare subsides.

House renovation stress continuing to impact wife's health condition. Timeline extension of floor project to 5+ months means continued living in construction environment affecting her wellbeing. Cultural contrast noted between wife's family offering immediate concrete help versus his family's extended "gift" creating ongoing stress.

## Daily Life Management
Morning quiet time restrictions (7am-12pm) have now expanded to include laundry, dishes, showers, and other household activities due to new washer affecting water pressure. Client now functionally restricted to 12pm-6pm window (25% of day) for all basic household activities. Pattern shows expanding restrictions rather than problem-solving within existing accommodations.

## Intimacy and Connection
Identified long-term pattern of intimacy initiation resistance due to emotional burnout from years of being primary emotional support. Enjoys physical connection when it happens but struggles with natural desire to initiate. Chronic task-management mental mode interfering with romantic connection.

## Social Media Addiction
Client identified problematic Reddit usage pattern involving infinite scrolling and procrastination. Reddit serves as primary source for sports news (Liverpool FC, Patriots, Celtics, Red Sox), Warhammer 40k, world news, politics, local news, and tech content. Automatic phone checking first thing in morning. Experiences "just one more" scrolling cycle with approximately 25% relevant content but gets trapped in dopamine-seeking behavior. Working from home provides no external accountability. Willpower alone ineffective against strong urges during downtime moments. Already has FreshRSS instance setup, using twice weekly but lacking good sports sources and experiencing too much noise-to-signal ratio.

# Strategy Tracker

- **Stress Recognition**: Strategies discussed previously - need to implement during current high-stress period with family visit and wife's flare.

- **Beach Morning Routine**: Started but challenged by expanding house restrictions. Need to maintain boundaries on reasonable vs unreasonable accommodations while supporting legitimate medical needs.

- **Family Boundary Setting**: Successfully implemented boundary-setting with stepdad when he couldn't respect house rules, demonstrating prioritization of wife's needs over family peace-keeping. Decision made to avoid confrontational conversations with family about timeline disappointment to prevent additional complications. Focus shifted to protecting viable relationships (mom, half-brother) while managing stepdad's dysfunction through distance rather than engagement.

- **Accommodation Limits**: Client has reached his accommodation limit and prepared comprehensive conversation strategy using temporary vs permanent restriction framework. Recognized pattern where wife deflects boundary discussions through emotional escalation rather than problem-solving. Ready to hold boundary even if conversation escalates significantly.

- **Time Restriction Pattern**: Client has identified that individual accommodation requests are symptoms of larger pattern - systematic compression of his functional time in own home. Ready to shift from individual battle conversations to bigger picture sustainability discussion about coexistence without further time restrictions.

- **Social Media Addiction > Reddit**: New approach identified: Complete cessation with urge tracking rather than content curation solutions. Client recognized core issue as dopamine addiction requiring interruption of automatic checking behavior. Simple Obsidian-based tracking system created to document urge triggers and build intentional information sources. Focus shifted from managing Reddit usage to eliminating it entirely while understanding underlying information needs.

# Session Notes

=== SESSION START ===
## Session 04-30-25

### Issues Discussed
Wife's chronic pain flare triggered by work stress and family visit; frustration with her avoidance of medical care; anger about divorce article she sent; feeling caught between supporting her and maintaining own needs; daily morning restrictions (7am-12pm quiet time) impacting productivity and autonomy; wife's controlling behaviors during flares

### Key Insights
Recognized pattern where stress triggers wife's pain which creates more stress (vicious cycle); identified that wife's need for control during flares is her attempt to manage unpredictable health situation; acknowledged frustration with feeling like loyalty is constantly questioned; realized wife hasn't seen specialists in over a year, possibly due to recent move and discouragement with lack of progress

### Strategies Introduced/Discussed
Three approaches for managing divorce article discussion - brief acknowledgment with boundaries, scheduling specific discussion time, or validating feelings without lengthy engagement; importance of timing conversations about medical care after flare subsides rather than during crisis

### Progress Updates
Family visit happening this weekend with agreed-upon morning noise restrictions; wife experiencing flare coinciding with multiple stressors (reduced work hours, family visit); living situation still impacted by ongoing renovations

### Action Items
Plan conversation with wife about resuming medical care after current flare ends; implement one of the three approaches for handling divorce article discussion; focus on getting through family visit weekend; consider how to frame medical care discussion as support rather than criticism
=== SESSION END ===

=== SESSION START ===
## Session 05-20-25

### Issues Discussed
Wife sent divorce article triggering anticipatory anxiety about day derailment; successful navigation of that situation; escalating morning routine restrictions (kitchen access, water, dog); deeper exploration of intimacy/affection disconnect - feeling unable to naturally want to initiate despite enjoying closeness when it happens; chronic emotional burnout from years of being primary emotional support; task-management mental mode preventing relaxation and romantic connection; guilt about relaxing and self-care; expanding control issues around house access for basic needs like water and dog

### Key Insights
Intimacy resistance stems from years of emotional depletion and caregiver burnout, not lack of love; procrastination is attempt to steal back autonomy when feeling over-responsible; being in constant task-management mode kills natural desire for connection; wife's accommodation requests expanding beyond reasonable (now includes basic kitchen access); current restrictions feel like rewarding unreasonable control rather than legitimate medical accommodation

### Strategies Introduced/Discussed
Scheduling relaxation as a task to bypass guilt; morning mental inventory for intimacy intentions before entering task mode; beach coffee mornings for genuine relaxation away from house responsibilities; reframing rest as necessary maintenance rather than laziness; holding boundaries on basic house functioning (water, dog access)

### Progress Updates
Successfully handled divorce article conversation without it derailing entire day; started morning beach routine but feeling unable to relax due to new restrictions; relationship dynamic showing pattern of expanding control despite accommodations already made

### Action Items
Implement morning beach coffee routine for relaxation; practice scheduled relaxation periods; try weekly intentional intimacy initiation; maintain boundary about basic kitchen/house access while being willing to discuss reasonable solutions

=== SESSION START ===
## Session 05-28-25

### Issues Discussed
Escalating morning kitchen restrictions now limited to 1-hour windows out of 4 hours; wife's expanding control over basic house access including getting water from fridge; recognition this has become his absolute boundary; preparation for difficult conversation about reasonable vs unreasonable accommodations

### Key Insights
Role-play revealed wife's pattern of deflecting boundary conversations through emotional escalation, crisis mode, and nuclear threats rather than problem-solving; identified logical inconsistency between managing uncontrollable apartment noise vs requiring complete silence for basic activities; recognized that maximum control is being exercised now that it's available rather than using previously demonstrated coping skills; client has reached his limit for accommodation

### Strategies Introduced/Discussed
Conversation framework starting with understanding (temporary vs permanent restrictions) rather than accusations; using apartment vs house noise comparison as strongest logical argument; prepared responses to multiple deflection tactics; study guide format to prevent caving under pressure during difficult conversation

### Progress Updates
Client has identified absolute boundary after restrictions expanded to basic kitchen access including water; prepared for potentially relationship-defining conversation about sustainable vs unsustainable accommodation levels

### Action Items
Have boundary conversation using prepared study guide; start with temporary vs permanent question; hold ground despite escalation; stay focused on practical problem-solving; determine if reasonable accommodation is possible or if professional help needed
=== SESSION END ===

=== SESSION START ===
## Session 05-31-25

### Issues Discussed
Family disappointment over 5-month floor delay despite working to get house ready; wife's hurt about therapy suggestion escalating to "I don't want to be open with you"; cultural differences in family support (wife's immigrant family offering concrete help vs. his family's extended "gift"); stepdad's poor time management affecting project timelines; balancing family relationships while protecting wife from additional stress

### Key Insights
Wife's statement reveals years-long pattern of emotional withdrawal and feeling unsafe being vulnerable; family "gift" has become burden due to stepdad's controlling approach and poor boundaries; mom caught in middle between wanting to help and stepdad's rigidity; previous confrontation where client told stepdad to leave demonstrated commitment to wife's wellbeing over family peace-keeping

### Strategies Introduced/Discussed
Responding to wife's vulnerability by centering her experience rather than explaining intentions; keeping house topics off-limits in family conversations; accepting family limitations rather than trying to change dynamics; focusing energy on relationships that can be influenced (mom, half-brother) rather than those that can't (stepdad)

### Progress Updates
Successfully reframed response to wife's vulnerability; made decision to let floor timeline play out rather than confronting family; recognized that stepdad's work patterns reflect broader time management and boundary issues

### Action Items
Maintain boundaries about house discussions with family; if wife opens up more about emotional withdrawal, focus on listening and witnessing rather than defending; keep family contact separate from house stress
=== SESSION END ===

=== SESSION START ===
## Session 06-02-25

### Issues Discussed
Laundry restriction request due to new washer affecting water pressure; struggle with determining reasonable vs unreasonable accommodations; wife's slow progress on medical care despite some movement; expanding time restrictions now affecting all household activities (laundry, dishes, showers) to 12pm-6pm window only

### Key Insights
Real issue isn't individual requests but systematic compression of client's functional time in own home from morning restrictions; wife frames her medical self-care as accommodation to him, creating pressure for him to match with unreasonable restrictions; current solution pattern always involves restricting his schedule rather than finding alternatives; he's moving toward tenant status with restricted privileges rather than partner sharing home

### Strategies Introduced/Discussed
Reframing conversations from "what times work" to "how can we solve this without further restricting my schedule"; focusing on spatial, equipment, or alternative solutions rather than time-based restrictions; recognizing medical self-care vs relationship accommodation distinction

### Progress Updates
Wife making slow progress on medical care referrals but still resistant to therapy; client recognizing pattern of shrinking functional time window rather than individual accommodation issues

### Action Items
Prepare for bigger conversation about sustainable coexistence rather than individual accommodation battles; practice articulating that current trajectory is unsustainable; consider non-time-restriction solutions (spatial, equipment, routine adjustments)
=== SESSION END ===

=== SESSION START ===
## Session 06-06-25 (Session A)

### Issues Discussed
Reddit addiction and infinite scrolling behavior; automatic morning phone checking; "just one more" cycle and dopamine-seeking; lack of external accountability working from home; previous RSS attempts and current FreshRSS usage; desire for 10-30 curated daily articles without noise

### Key Insights
Recognizes behavior in moment but struggles to stop due to strong urges; Reddit provides 25% relevant content vs RSS at 1% but traps in infinite scroll; addiction manifests during downtime/transitions, not when engaged; wants shift from "hunting and gathering" to "delivered meal" content consumption

### Strategies Introduced/Discussed
Using subreddit approved source lists to build RSS feeds; leveraging Reddit's crowd-sourced curation for RSS setup; converting Twitter accounts to RSS via nitter for sports content

### Progress Updates
Client motivated to try RSS approach using subreddit curation to reduce setup burden and improve sports content quality

### Action Items
Research approved sources from team subreddits (Liverpool FC, Patriots, Celtics, Red Sox); set up sports RSS feeds using nitter for Twitter accounts; aim for 10-30 quality daily articles setup
=== SESSION END ===

=== SESSION START ===
## Session 06-06-25 (Session B)

### Issues Discussed
Shift from Reddit content management to complete cessation; recognition that core issue is dopamine addiction and loss of control over attention; specific addiction triggers (Liverpool transfers, Black Templars codex rumors); desire to quit Reddit entirely rather than moderate usage

### Key Insights
Client correctly identified this as addiction problem rather than content curation issue; understood that "hunting mode" for infrequent but unpredictable updates creates strongest addiction pattern; recognized automatic checking behavior needs interruption, not management

### Strategies Introduced/Discussed
Friction-based intervention using Obsidian notes to track urges and reasons; replacement actions to interrupt automatic behavior; tracking urges as data to identify real information needs vs dopamine-seeking; complete cessation approach rather than moderation

### Progress Updates
Client created streamlined tracking system focused on understanding urge triggers; committed to complete Reddit cessation rather than usage management; ready to implement urge documentation protocol

### Action Items
Use simplified Obsidian tracking document when Reddit urges arise; document the "why" behind each urge before taking any action; set up alternative sources for Liverpool transfers and Black Templars news; remove Reddit access from all devices
