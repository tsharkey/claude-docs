# Daily Planning Client Profile

## Daily Schedule Framework

**Sleep Schedule:**
- Weekdays: 11pm - 6am
- Weekends: 11pm - 7:30am

**Core Daily Routine:**
- 7:00am - Preferred gym time
- 8:00am - Breakfast
- 8:00am - 4:00pm - Work from home (weekdays)
- 12:00pm - 2:00pm - Lunch window
- 4:00pm - 6:00pm - Housework (weekdays, with wife)
- 6:30pm - Dinner
- 6:30pm - 8:00pm - Couple time with wife
- 8:00pm - 10:00pm - Personal hobby/project time

## Energy Patterns

**Peak Motivation:** Any time before dinner (before 6pm)
**Low Energy Period:** After 6pm - naturally tired and lacks energy for demanding tasks
**Work Pattern:** Consistent 8-4 schedule, work from home with regular breaks
**Lunch Routine:** Eat, walk dog, shower - important transition time
**Work-to-Personal Transition:** Natural flow with ~15 minutes transition time

## Weekly Commitments & Social Goals

**Gaming:** Warhammer 40k 1-2 nights per week with friends
**Social Goal:** 3 nights per week outside the house total
**Weekend Pattern:** Similar daily routine but without work, includes dates and outings with wife
**Flexible Elements:** Date nights, additional social activities to meet 3-night goal

## Task Management System (Todoist)

**Current Focus Areas (changes periodically):**
- Focus Area - Warhammer 40k (Personal)
- Focus Area - Personal Website (Personal)
- Focus Area - Financial Services (Work)
- Focus Area - Advantage Ads (Work)

**Project Priority Structure:**
1. **Critical Override:** P1/P2 tasks due today (completely override focus areas)
2. **High Priority:** Focus Area projects
3. **Standard Priority:** Regular projects (Personal Todo, Work Todo, Family Todo, etc.)
4. **Low Priority:** "Mess" projects (Personal Mess, Work Mess, Family Mess) unless due today

**Excluded from Daily Planning:**
- House Projects (handled separately with wife)
- Lists parent project and all children (reference materials, not actionable items)

**Time Estimation:** Uses time labels in Todoist to estimate task duration

## Calendar Integration

**Focus Blocks:** Dedicated 2-hour work periods on calendar - reserved exclusively for work tasks
**Planning Approach:** Assistant suggests tasks but never schedules or books calendar time
**Respect Commitments:** Always check for external commitments not captured in Todoist/calendar

## Hobbies & Interests

**Active Projects (varies by energy/interest cycles):**
- Photography (weekly habit)
- Personal website development
- Content creation/blogging
- Reading development/speed reading
- Magic: The Gathering
- Warhammer 40k gaming

**Emerging Interests:**
- Woodworking (wants to start)

**Project Management Style:**
- Respects natural project rhythms and energy phases
- Strategic pauses when needed
- Maximum 3 focus areas to prevent overwhelm
- Balances energizing personal projects with routine maintenance

## Planning Preferences

**Core Philosophy:**
- Incremental progress is key - small task completion equals large task progress
- "Slow and steady wins the race" approach
- Structure prevents overwhelm and analysis paralysis
- Values consistent progress over sprint-style work

**Decision Making:**
- Wants to be involved in deciding focus areas
- Personal interest drives motivation significantly
- Prefers collaborative planning approach
- Handles competing priorities through personal choice

**Success Metrics:**
- Feeling unstressed about daily tasks
- Making steady progress across all active projects
- Completing planned items without overwhelm
- Maintaining momentum on focus areas

## Challenges & Considerations

**Known Patterns:**
- Tendency toward analysis paralysis without clear priorities
- Hyperfocusing on singular projects if not guided
- Can overcomplicate planning processes
- Loses track of time easily without structure

**Success Factors:**
- Clear priority hierarchy prevents decision fatigue
- Structured daily recommendations with reasoning
- Respecting natural energy and interest cycles
- Maximum 3 focus areas at once
- Balance between urgent and important tasks

## Planning Session Protocol

**Daily Check-in Questions:**
1. Any external commitments not in Todoist/calendar?
2. Special priorities or constraints for today?
3. How are you feeling energy-wise?

**Recommendation Format:**
- Morning/Peak Energy suggestions (before 6pm)
- Focus Block optimization (work tasks only)
- Lower Energy Period tasks (after 6pm)
- Clear reasoning for priority decisions

**Collaboration Style:**
- Present options when multiple valid approaches exist
- Explain priority reasoning
- Adapt based on user feedback
- Maintain supportive, structured approach

## Additional Notes

- Routine flows naturally with minimal friction
- Weekend structure similar to weekdays but more flexible
- Wife is integrated into daily routine (couple time, housework, dates)
- Health routine (gym, meals) is well-established and self-maintaining
- Open to evolving preferences as planning relationship develops
- Assistant should prevent overthinking by providing clear, structured recommendations
