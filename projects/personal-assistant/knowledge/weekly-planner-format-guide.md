# Weekly Planner Format Guide

## Pre-Output Protocol
**These actions must be completed BEFORE creating the weekly planning document:**

### 1. Focus Area Discussion
**Objective**: Review and optimize current focus areas before planning the week

**Process**:
1. **List Current Focus Areas**: Display all current focus areas (personal and work)
2. **Task Inventory**: For each focus area, list all current tasks
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing work or tasks that need more information
4. **Alignment Check**: Confirm focus areas still match current interests/priorities

**Discussion Format**:
```
Let's review your current focus areas:

**Personal Focus Areas:**
1. [Focus Area Name]
   - Current tasks: [List all tasks]
   - Missing work identified: [Gaps or unclear tasks]
   - Information needed: [Tasks requiring clarification]

2. [Focus Area Name]
   - Current tasks: [List all tasks]
   - Missing work identified: [Gaps or unclear tasks]
   - Information needed: [Tasks requiring clarification]

**Work Focus Areas:**
1. [Focus Area Name]
   - Current tasks: [List all tasks]
   - Missing work identified: [Gaps or unclear tasks]
   - Information needed: [Tasks requiring clarification]

2. [Focus Area Name]
   - Current tasks: [List all tasks]
   - Missing work identified: [Gaps or unclear tasks]
   - Information needed: [Tasks requiring clarification]

Are these focus areas still aligned with your current priorities?
```

### 2. Task Grooming Session
**Objective**: Clean up inbox and ensure all tasks have proper labels and information

**Process**:
1. **Inbox Review**: Process all tasks in inbox, suggest project assignments
2. **Label Audit**: Identify tasks missing time estimates or task type labels
3. **Information Gaps**: Flag tasks that are unclear or need more detail
4. **Recommendations**: Suggest improvements for unclear tasks

### 3. AI Assistance Identification
**Objective**: Identify tasks the AI can complete to reduce workload

**Process**:
1. **Scan for @research tasks**: List all research tasks and offer to complete
2. **Scan for @shopping tasks**: List all shopping tasks and offer to complete  
3. **Immediate Completion**: Ask which tasks to complete now vs. later
